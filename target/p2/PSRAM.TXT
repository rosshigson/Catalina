This file describes Catalina's support for PSRAM. However, there is not 
currently a separate add-on board for PSRAM - the Parallax Hyper RAM board 
is supported by another set of configuration files (for details of that 
support, see the file HYPER.TXT).

The only hardware currently supported by these PSRAM configuration files is 
the PSRAM that is included on some Parallax P2 EDGE boards (specifically, the 
P2-EC32MB). 

The relevant files in the target\p2 directory are:

   psram.t            PSRAM startup code and initialization data.
   psram.inc          PSRAM XMM access functions.
   PSRAM_XMM.def      Common PSRAM/HyperRAM definitions for Rogloh's drivers.
   cogpsram.t         Rogloh's original PSRAM driver, modified for Catalina.

The file "psram.t" contains the initialization data for the PSRAM, but 
this mostly just uses the definitions (e.g. pin definitions) in the platform 
configuration files of those platforms that support PSRAM, such as the
P2_EDGE. See the section in the file P2EDGE.inc titled "PSRAM constants".

Using PSRAM is enabled simply by linking with the psram library. There is
a Catalina symbol (PSRAM) associated with PSRAM support, but it does not
normally need to be explicitly specified for the PSRAM internal to the 
P2_EDGE board.

Catalina supports using 32Mb of PSRAM as storage, but only the first 16Mb of 
PSRAM can currently be used to execute XMM programs.

There is a demo program in the Catalina demos\examples folder, which can be 
compiled for a P2_EDGE fitted with PSRAM as follows:

   catalina -p2 -lpsram -lci ex_psram.c -C P2_EDGE 

This program can also be compiled as an XMM program to execute from PSRAM
simply by adding -C LARGE or -C SMALL on the command line. For example:

   catalina -p2 -lpsram -lci ex_psram.c -C P2_EDGE -C LARGE

To load a program into PSRAM requires that the Catalina XMM load utilities
be built, using the build_all script. When building, do not specify an 
XMM add-on board, but answer Y to the question asking whether or not the 
P2_EDGE has PSRAM or SRAM installed.
