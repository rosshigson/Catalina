The P2_WIFI_SLAVE configuration file (P2WIFI_M.inc) is used when the 
Catalina symbol P2_WIFI_SLAVE is defined on the Catalina command-line 
(as -C P2_WIFI_SLAVE) or included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_WIFI_SLAVE

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_WIFI_SLAVE
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_WIFI_SLAVE platform configuration file is configured the same as a 
P2_EDGE, but with a WiFi adaptor installed on pin group 16, which uses the 
first two serial ports. This can be used with either the 2 port or 8 port 
serial plugin. It can be modified to have the WiFi adaptor on another pin 
group if required - see the file "demos/wifi/README.TXT" for more details.

To demonstrate WiFi used in conjunction with a serial ALOHA link, the 8 port 
serial plugin must be used. The P2_WIFI_MASTER and P2_WIFI_SLAVE platform
configuration files configure the third serial port on pins 0 & 1.
