The P2_EDGE configuration file (P2EDGE.inc) is used when the Catalina 
symbol P2_EDGE is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2_EDGE) or
included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_EDGE

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_EDGE
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_EDGE configuration file supports both the P2_EC and P2-EC32MB.

The P2_EDGE configuration file includes XMM RAM definitions to suit both
the internal PSRAM on the P2-EC32MB as well as the Parallax Hyper RAM add-on 
board. One or the other can be used as additional RAM storage by linking with
the psram or hyper libraries respectively (i.e. adding -lpsram or -lhyper to 
the Catalina command line), and can also be used as XMM RAM by specifying 
-C PSRAM or -C HYPER (respectively) on the Catalina command line. If neither
is specified then using PSRAM as XMM is the default.

Note that PSRAM and Hyper RAM cannot both be used in the same program.
