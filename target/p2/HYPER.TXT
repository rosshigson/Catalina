This file describes Catalina's support for the Parallax HyperFlash & HyperRAM 
add-on board (specifically, the 64004-ES). This board is supported on both the
P2 Evaluation board and P2 Edge board (with or without PSRAM of its own - but
note that the PSRAM on the P2 Edge is supported by a DIFFERENT set of files - 
see PSRAM.TXT for details).

The relevant files in the target\p2 directory are:

   hyper.t            Hyper RAM startup code and initialization data.
   hyper.inc          Hyper XMM access functions.
   psram.def          Common PSRAM/HyperRAM definitions for Rogloh's drivers.
   coghyper.t         Rogloh's original Hyper driver, modified for Catalina.

The file "hyper.t" contains the initialization data for the board, but 
this mostly just uses the definitions (e.g. base pin definitions) in the 
platform configuration files of those platforms that support Hyper RAM, such 
as the P2_EVAL and P2_EDGE. See the section in the files P2EVAL.inc and 
P2EDGE.inc titled "Hyper Flash / Hyper RAM constants".

The default base pin definitions depend on the board:

   P2_EDGE - base pin is 0
   P2_EVAL - base pin is 32

Using Hyper RAM is enabled simply by linking with the hyper library. There is
a Catalina symbol (HYPER) associated with the Hyper RAM add-on board, but it 
does not normally need to be explicitly specified unless the Hyper RAM is
also used as XMM RAM on a board that also includes some built-in XMM RAM 
(see the XMM example below). 

Catalina supports using 16Mb of Hyper RAM and 32Mb of Hyper Flash as storage,
but only the 16Mb of Hyper RAM can currently be used to execute XMM programs.

There is a demo program in the Catalina demos\examples folder, which can be 
compiled for a P2_EVAL fitted with the Hyper RAM add-on board as follows:

   catalina -p2 -lhyper -lci ex_hyper.c -C P2_EVAL 

The same program can be compiled for a P2_EDGE fitted with the Hyper RAM 
add-on board as follows:

   catalina -p2 -lhyper -lci ex_hyper.c -C P2_EDGE 

This program can also be compiled as an XMM program to execute from Hyper RAM
simply by adding -C LARGE or -C SMALL on the command line. For example:

   catalina -p2 -lhyper -lci ex_hyper.c -C P2_EVAL -C LARGE

Note that if this program is compiled as an XMM program for the P2_EDGE, 
then -C HYPER will need to be added, to tell the P2_EDGE to use Hyper RAM
rather than PSRAM as XMM RAM, since Catalina cannot currenly use both PSRAM 
and Hyper RAM in the same program. For example:

  catalina -p2 -lhyper -lci ex_hyper.c -C P2_EDGE -C LARGE -C HYPER

To load a program into Hyper RAM requires that the Catalina XMM load utilities
be built, using the build_all script. When building, specify HYPER as the 
XMM add-on board.
