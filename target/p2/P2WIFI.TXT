The P2_WIFI configuration file (P2WIFI.inc) is used when the Catalina 
symbol P2_WIFI is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2_WIFI) or
included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_WIFI

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_WIFI
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_WIFI board is configured the same as a P2_EDGE board, but with a WiFi 
adaptor installed on pin group 16. It can be modified to have the WiFi adaptor
on another pin group if required - see the file "demos/wifi/README.TXT" for 
more details.
