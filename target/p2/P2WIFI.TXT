The P2_WIFI configuration file (P2WIFI.inc) is used when the Catalina 
symbol P2_WIFI is defined on the Catalina command-line (as -C P2_WIFI) or
included in the definition of CATALINA_DEFINE.

For example:

   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c -C P2_WIFI

or

   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_WIFI
   catalina -p2 -lc hello_world.c

The P2_WIFI configuration file is intended to be modified to suit any
platform not otherwise supported by Catalina. It is also the default
configuration file used if no other file is specified by defining an
appropriate Catalina symbol. By default, P2_WIFI is configured the same
as the P2_EDGE, but since it is intended to be modified, this should not
be relied upon, and a specific board should always be specifiesd. 

The P2_WIFI board is configured the same as a P2_EDGE board, but with a WiFi 
adaptor installed on pin group 16. It can be modified to have the WiFi adaptor
on another pin group if required - see the file "demos/wifi/README.TXT" for 
more details.
