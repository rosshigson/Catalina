IMPORTANT: This WIFI.TXT file discusses only the WiFi RPC extension to eLua.
For details on the ALOHA serial extension to eLua, see the file README.TXT.

There are several variants of essentially the same eLua client/server program  
in this folder. 

Compile them all using by using the 'build_rpc' script. This script 
builds eLua for multiple different platforms, and so no platform should be 
specified either on the command line or using CATALINA_DEFINE. For example:

   unset CATALINA_DEFINE
   build_rpc

The script builds the following binaries for P2_WIFI_MASTER:

   catapult rlua.c
   mv rlua.bin rmaster.bin

   catapult rluax.c
   mv rluax.bin rmasterx.bin

and the following binaries for P2_WIFI_SLAVE:

   catapult rlua.c
   mv rlua.bin rslave.bin

   catapult rluax.c
   mv rluax.bin rslavex.bin

and the following binaries for P2_WIFI:

   catapult rlua.c
   catapult rluax.c
   catapult rluax2.c
   catapult rluafx.c

They can also be compiled individually using Catapult. For example:

On Windows:
   set CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_WIFI
   catapult rlua.c
   catapult rluax.c
   catapult rluax2.c
   catapult rluafx.c

On Pi OS or Linux:
   export CATALINA_DEFINE=P2_WIFI
   catapult rlua.c
   catapult rluax.c
   catapult rluax2.c
   catapult rluafx.c
