/*
 * estring.c : example of how to read data from EEPROMs from an XEPROM program.
 * 
 * Compile this program using a command like:
 *   catalina -C HYDRA -C TTY -C SMALL -C XEPROM -C CACHED_1K -y -lci estring.c 
 *
 * Note that you need a platform with an EEPROM larger than 32kb, and you need
 * a method of programming the resulting binary into the EEPROM. On the Hydra 
 * you can use the Hydra Asset Manager to do this. On other platforms you can
 * use the build_utilities command and then use the EEPROM program loader. 
 * For example:
 *    payload -i EEPROM estring.binary
