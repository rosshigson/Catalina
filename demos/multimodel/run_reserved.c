 *   This primary program runs "hello_world.c" as a subsidiary program twice. *
 *   It runs it first as a CMM program, then again as an LMM program.         *
 *   The subsidiary program must be compiled by catalina, and then turned     *
 *   into a blob suitable for inclusion in this program by the spinc utility. *
 *                                                                            *
 *   This program does trivial memory management. An area on the stack is     *
 *   allocated for the subsidary programs to run, and the programs must be    *
 *   compiled to be loaded and run at this address. This address is set to    *
 *   0x7BAC in the Makefile, which is suitable for most platforms when        *
 *   compiling this program as LMM and using the TTY HMI option. However,     *
 *   it will not be suitable if this program is instead  compiled with other  *
 *   options, or as an XMM program. However, the program itself checks        *
 *   whether the included programs are compiled to run at the appropriate     *
 *   address and print a message if this is not the case.                     *
 *   If the message is displayed, simply edit the Makefile and replace        *
 *   0x7BAC with the correct address (which will be displayed by this         *
 *   program when run). Then rebuild the program and run it again             *
 *                                                                            *
 *   This primary program can be compiled as a CMM, LMM, XMM SMALL or XMM     *
 *   LARGE program.                                                           *
 *                                                                            *
 *   See the Makefile for more details.                                       *
 *                                                                            *
