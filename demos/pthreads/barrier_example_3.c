/* pthread_barrier_demo.c

   A demonstration of the use of the pthreads barrier API.

   Usage: pthread_barrier_demo num-barriers num-threads

   The program creates 'num-threads' threads, each of which loop
   'num-threads' times, waiting on the same barrier.

   Modified to be Catalina (ANSI C) compatible by Ross Higson.
